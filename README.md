# My CI/CD Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Ansible.

## Files
- `Jenkinsfile`: Jenkins pipeline definition.
- `playbook.yml`: Ansible playbook for configuration management.
- `inventory.ini`: Ansible inventory file.

## Steps to Implement

1. **Set Up Jenkins Pipeline**
   - Create a new Jenkins pipeline job.
   - Add the `Jenkinsfile` to your project's repository.

2. **Configure Ansible Playbook**
   - Write the `playbook.yml` file to define the deployment steps.
   - Create an inventory file `inventory.ini` to define your target hosts.

3. **Run the Pipeline**
   - Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to execute the CI/CD process.
   - Ensure that the pipeline builds, tests, and deploys the application as expected.
